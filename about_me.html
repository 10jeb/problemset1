        <h1>Jeremy Boyd</h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>This past summer I went out of the country for the first time to go to Japan for the Pok√©mon World Championships. I spectated the video game tournament and got to play in some side events against players from around the world. Compared to anywhere I've been in the US, Japan is generally cleaner, quieter, and objects seem far more respected there. It was a phenomenal trip.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Below, some favorite pet names:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A dolphin named Squid</li>
            <li>A dog named Rusty</li>
            <li>A raven named Flaps</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://www.himalayanhutmanchester.com/">This</a> restaurant is so delicious and so casually fancy. It's a perfect spot for a date, and one time I forgot to pay when picking up takeout, so I paid next time I went, and the staff was very kind about the situation.</p>

        <p>This is Orange Chicken. I debated between this and Chicken Biryani, but I like the flavor of the chicken more in this dish. I like to eat it with white rice and broccoli while watching some show or video on YouTube with a friend or alone. I much prefer when the chicken is not made with dark meat.
